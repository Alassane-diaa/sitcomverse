# Sitcomverse

This project was created as part of the first-year humanities course **"Culture geek et Jeux Vid√©os"** at √âcole des Mines de Nancy. It is an interactive 3D web application that allows users to explore iconic sitcoms through an immersive interface.
The goal is to create a fun and visually engaging experience to showcase major sitcoms that have shaped geek and popular culture. Users can navigate through a 3D space, where each show is represented by an image and a description.
